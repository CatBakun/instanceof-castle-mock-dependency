# Grunt-castle instanceof-mock-returned import Issue
This is a recreation for [the issue](https://github.com/walmartlabs/grunt-castle/issues/29)

## Overview
> When you import a module X in a mock, its instance or reference is not the same for
> that same module imported in your source. That causes you to not be able to use the
> instanceof operator successfully.

## To use:

```
npm install
```

```
grunt castle
```
